# 🥗 Eco-Feed AI: Food Waste Prediction & Reduction System

### 📌 Project Overview
Eco-Feed AI is a Machine Learning-based Decision Support System designed to minimize food waste in institutional canteens and hostels. By analyzing historical attendance and menu data, the system provides precise cooking recommendations.

### ✨ Key Features
- **AI-Powered Predictions:** Uses Random Forest Regression to forecast food waste.
- **Smart Recommendations:** Suggests optimal cooking quantities with a safety buffer.
- **Sustainability Dashboard:** Tracks CO2 reduction and financial savings.
- **Interactive Visuals:** Dynamic charts showing waste trends.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **ML Library:** Scikit-Learn
- **Data Viz:** Plotly

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Food-Waste-Predictor.git](https://github.com/KumarDhobale/food_waste_prediction_system)

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the application:
   streamlit run app.py

# Dataset
The project uses food_data.csv containing:
day: Day of the week
students: Expected attendance
menu_type: Regular or Special
food_prepared: Quantity cooked (kg)
food_wasted: Quantity wasted (kg)
